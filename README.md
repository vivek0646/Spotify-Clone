Spotify Clone
This project is a fully responsive and user-friendly Spotify clone developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases my front-end development skills by providing a seamless music-playing experience.
Key features include:
- Modern and responsive design crafted with HTML and CSS
- Interactive music controls (play, pause, next) powered by JavaScript
- Smooth user interactions for an intuitive listening experience
- Git and GitHub integration, enhancing version control proficiency

Through this project, I refined my ability to create dynamic web applications and gained hands-on experience with front-end technologies.
